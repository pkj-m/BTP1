### Abstract 

Over the past years, there has been a steady growth in the performance capabilities of GPGPU platforms which have led to the popularity of parallel programming models such as CUDA by Nvidia. However, despite the massive increase in the compute ability of these platforms thanks to an exponential rise in the hardware-level parallelism they offer, software-level optimizations still fail to efficiently exploit the GPU architecture to their full potential. In this project, we study thread coarsening as a potential software-level optimization that could be used to increase the efficiency of kernels pertaining to convolutional neural networks by efficiently exploiting the enhanced hardware-level parallelism these devices have to offer.
